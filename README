Itzam/C
A Concise Embeddable Database Engine in Standard C

This document is a work in progress. I tend to learn by looking at code, and strongly suggest that you study the examples in the distribution's test directory for working examples of Itzam code. Yet I know how important hard docs can be, so I'm open to suggestions for improving or updating this document.

Itzam/C manages data storage using B-tree indexes, storing key-value pairs. Keys are identifiers of any fixed-length type for their associated value, and there is a one-to-one relationship between keys and values. Itzam/C supports transactions with rollback, multiple threads accessing the same database, and other features not usually found in small database engines.

In the real world, Itzam/C is the foundation of several business applications, including mission-critical systems running 24/365.

Currently, Itzam is a C99 64-bit only engine enabled for threaded applications, written in C11. 

Itzam is not a SQL database, or something that can be accessed from ADO. You can build relational (or network, or...) database systems with Itzam as the underlying mechanic — but that really isn't what Itzam was meant for. The vast majority of applications do not need Oracle or SQL Server — they need a simple way to associate information with a key value, for retrieval. This is the niche Itzam occupies.

Itzam has a long and varied history. It began as example code in my first book, C++ Components and Algorithms (1992). The original code was meant to teach C++, yet several people contacted me asking if they could use it in various projects. Some even offered to pay for the code.

And so I reworked the book code into something worthy of production code. After many versions (and a side-trip into Java under the name "Jisp"), I arrived at the Itzam you see today.

The current reference version is written in C for a variety of reasons. C produces small code and can be wrapped in various other programming languages. By writing in Standard C, I maintain portability. The current code has seen production and commercial use across PCs, cell phones, and Macs.

Why "Itzam"?

Naming projects is always difficult; I sometimes think every word in English has been appropriated by someone. So I've had to stretch my linguistic horizons. "Itzam" is one of several Mayan words for iguana; given the fondness of iguanas for trees, and the presence of an iguana in my house, the name seemed rather fitting.

The Itzam logo (and all other site art) was created by my eldest daughter Elora, using a combination of commercial and open source tools.
